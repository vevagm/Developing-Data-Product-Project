# Developing-Data-Product-Project

This assignment has two parts. First, I created a Shiny application and deployed it on Rstudio's servers. Second, I use Rstudio Presenter to prepare a reproducible pitch presentation about your application.

The application includes the following:

* Form of input (widget: textbox, radio button, checkbox, ...)
* Operation on the ui input in sever.R
* Some reactive output displayed as a result of server calculations
* Enough documentation so that a novice user could use your application.
* The documentation should be at the Shiny website itself. Do not post to an external link.

The shinny app can be seen at https://vevagm.shinyapps.io/dataProducts. It is a fake prediction model for instagram likes.

Your presentation must satisfy the following

* It must be done in Rstudio Presenter
* It must be 5 pages
* It must be hosted on github
* It must contained some embedded R code that gets run when slidifying the document

The presentation can be seen at http://vevagm.github.io/Developing-Data-Product-Project/Followers.html#/
